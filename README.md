# DiscordBot
Open Source JavaScript based Discord Bot Project

This is a project that I will work on the side during my School and co-op for fun.

# Current Functionality:

1. Replies "Pong!" and tags the user if "Ping" is sent as a message
2. Enjoys being called a "Good Bot" (not case sensitive!) and will react with ðŸ’¯
3. Using the command "-joke" will have the bot reply with a joke from src/jokes.json
4. Using the command "-spongebob" followed by any  message will cause the bot to reply with the mocking spongebob meme-ified version
4. Using the command "-youtube" followed by a keyword will return the url of the first video that is found on youtube when searching that keyword

# TODO & Potential Future Functionality

1. Implement Twitter API to access tweets
2. Implement Youtube API to access youtube videos
3. Further use the Youtube API so i can do more than fetch videos
4. Implement Riot Games API for friends to access League of Legends
5. Add more discord functionality so the bot can join voice channels
